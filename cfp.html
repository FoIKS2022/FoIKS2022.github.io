<h1>Call for Papers</h1>


<p>
The FoIKS symposia provide a biennial forum for presenting and discussing theoretical and applied research on information and knowledge systems. The goal is to bring together researchers with an interest in this subject, share research experiences, promote collaboration and identify new issues and directions for future research.
</p>

<p>
FoIKS 2022 solicits original contributions (as well as extensions of previously published contributions) dealing with any foundational aspect of information and knowledge systems. This includes submissions that apply ideas, theories or methods from specific disciplines to information and knowledge systems. Examples of such disciplines are discrete mathematics, logic and algebra, model theory, information theory, complexity theory, algorithmics and computation, statistics, and optimisation, among, of course, many others.
</p>

<p>
The FoIKS symposia are a forum for intensive discussions. Speakers will be given sufficient time to present their ideas and results within the larger context of their research. Furthermore, participants will be asked to prepare a first response to another contribution in order to initiate discussion.

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

<p>
For long papers, the suggested number of pages is 16, and the maximum number of pages is 18. For short papers, the maximum number of pages is 10. All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. Papers must be typeset using the Springer LaTeX2e style llncs for Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Submissions that deviate substantially from these guidelines may be rejected without review. Initial submissions must be in PDF format, but authors should keep in mind that the LaTeX2e source must be submitted for the final versions of accepted papers. Submissions in alternate formats, such as Microsoft Word, cannot be accepted for either initial or final versions. The submissions will be judged for scientific quality and for suitability as a basis for broader discussion.
</p>

<p>
  Submission is via the EasyChair link <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=foiks2022"> https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=foiks2022</a>


<h2>Publication</h2>
<p>
The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science. After the symposium, authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended journal versions of their papers for a FoIKS 2022 special issue of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence or another journal. Exact details will be provided on the conference website.
</p>


<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>
All questions about submissions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:foiks2022@easychair.org">foiks2022@easychair.org</a>.
